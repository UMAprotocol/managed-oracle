module that allows children to implement role-based access control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see {AccessControlEnumerable}. Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by using `public constant` hash digests: ```solidity bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\\\"MY_ROLE\\\"); ``` Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a function call, use {hasRole}: ```solidity function foo() public {     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));     ... } ``` Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}. By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using {_setRoleAdmin}. WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure accounts that have been granted it.

constructor() {     _disableInitializers(); } ``` ====\",\"details\":\"This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect. The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized. For example: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ```solidity contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {     function initialize() initializer public {         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");     } } contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");     } } ``` TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}. CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity. [CAUTION] ==== Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized. An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:

@dev Calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number in Z/nZ.\n If n is a prime, then Z/nZ is a field. In that case all elements are inversible, except 0.\n If n is not a prime, then Z/nZ is not a field, and some elements might not be inversible.\n If the input value is not inversible, 0 is returned.\n NOTE: If you know for sure that n is (big) a prime, it may be cheaper to use Fermat's little theorem and get the\n inverse using `Math.modExp(a, n - 2, n)`.

@dev Contract module that allows children to implement role-based access\n control mechanisms.

Some\n applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see\n {AccessControlEnumerable}.\n Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier.

The best way to achieve this is by\n using `public constant` hash digests:\n ```solidity\n bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\"MY_ROLE\");\n ```\n Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions.

Each role has an associated admin role, and only\n accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\n By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\n that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\n roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\n {_setRoleAdmin}.\n WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\n grant and revoke this role.

Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n For example:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```solidity\n contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n     function initialize() initializer public {\n         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n     }\n }\n contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n     }\n }\n ```\n TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n [CAUTION]\n ====\n Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\n the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```\n /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\n constructor() {\n     _disableInitializers();\n }\n ```\n ===="},"fullyImplemented":true,"linearizedBaseContracts":[1480],"name":"Initializable","nameLocation":"2367:13:2","scope":1481,"usedErrors":[1229,1232],"usedEvents":[1237]}],"license":"MIT"}},"lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/proxy/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol":{"id":3,"ast":{"absolutePath":"lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/proxy/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol","id":1663,"exportedSymbols":{"ERC1967Utils":[2503],"IERC1822Proxiable":[2209],"Initializable":[1480],"UUPSUpgradeable":[1662]},"nodeType":"SourceUnit","src":"115:6458:3","nodes":[{"id":1482,"nodeType":"PragmaDirective","src":"115:24:3","nodes":[],"literals":["solidity","^","0.8",".22"]},{"id":1484,"nodeType":"ImportDirective","src":"141:88:3","nodes":[],"absolutePath":"lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/interfaces/draft-IERC1822.sol","file":"@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/draft-IERC1822.sol","nameLocation":"-1:-1:-1","scope":1663,"sourceUnit":2210,"symbolAliases":[{"foreign":{"id":1483,"name":"IERC1822Proxiable","nodeType":"Identifier","overloadedDeclarations":[],"referencedDeclaration":2209,"src":"149:17:3","typeDescriptions":{}},"nameLocation":"-1:-1:-1"}],"unitAlias":""},{"id":1486,"nodeType":"ImportDirective","src":"230:84:3","nodes":[],"absolutePath":"lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/proxy/ERC1967/ERC1967Utils.sol","file":"@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/ERC1967/ERC1967Utils.sol","nameLocation":"-1:-1:-1","scope":1663,"sourceUnit":2504,"symbolAliases":[{"foreign":{"id":1485,"name":"ERC1967Utils","nodeType":"Identifier","overloadedDeclarations":[],"referencedDeclaration":2503,"src":"238:12:3","typeDescriptions":{}},"nameLocation":"-1:-1:-1"}],"unitAlias":""},{"id":1488,"nodeType":"ImportDirective","src":"315:50:3","nodes":[],"absolutePath":"lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol","file":"./Initializable.sol","nameLocation":"-1:-1:-1","scope":1663,"sourceUnit":1481,"symbolAliases":[{"foreign":{"id":1487,"name":"Initializable","nodeType":"Identifier","overloadedDeclarations":[],"referencedDeclaration":1480,"src":"323:13:3","typeDescriptions":{}},"nameLocation":"-1:-1:-1"}],"unitAlias":""},{"id":1662,"nodeType":"ContractDefinition","src":"986:5586:3","nodes":[{"id":1500,"nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","src":"1128:48:3","nodes":[],"constant":false,"documentation":{"id":1494,"nodeType":"StructuredDocumentation","src":"1062:61:3","text":"@custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow state-variable-immutable"},"mutability":"immutable","name":"__self","nameLocation":"1154:6:3","scope":1662,"stateVariable":true,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"},"typeName":{"id":1495,"name":"address","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1128:7:3","stateMutability":"nonpayable","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"value":{"arguments":[{"id":1498,"name":"this","nodeType":"Identifier","overloadedDeclarations":[],"referencedDeclaration":-28,"src":"1171:4:3","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_contract$_UUPSUpgradeable_$1662","typeString":"contract UUPSUpgradeable"}}],"expression":{"argumentTypes":[{"typeIdentifier":"t_contract$_UUPSUpgradeable_$1662","typeString":"contract UUPSUpgradeable"}],"id":1497,"isConstant":false,"isLValue":false,"isPure":true,"lValueRequested":false,"nodeType":"ElementaryTypeNameExpression","src":"1163:7:3","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_type$_t_address_$","typeString":"type(address)"},"typeName":{"id":1496,"name":"address","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1163:7:3","typeDescriptions":{}}},"id":1499,"isConstant":false,"isLValue":false,"isPure":false,"kind":"typeConversion","lValueRequested":false,"nameLocations":[],"names":[],"nodeType":"FunctionCall","src":"1163:13:3","tryCall":false,"typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"visibility":"private"},{"id":1504,"nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","src":"1819:58:3","nodes":[],"constant":true,"documentation":{"id":1501,"nodeType":"StructuredDocumentation","src":"1183:631:3","text":" @dev The version of the upgrade interface of the contract.
